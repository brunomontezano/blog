### Bio

Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree at the Federal University of Rio
Grande do Sul in the Postgraduate Program in Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences
(CAPES 7 concept) as a Master's Scholar. I have a Technical Course in Computer
Science from the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Rio
Grande do Sul - Câmpus Ibirubá (2015) and a Degree in Psychology from the
Catholic University of Pelotas (2021). I have already performed quantitative
data analysis activities (data from cohort studies and actigraphy, through the
use of inferential statistics, machine learning techniques and psychometrics),
statistical programming (R language and IBM SPSS software), data backup (tabular
data from questionnaires from tablets and actigraph data), data cleaning and
manipulation, report writing (in the format of structured documents, websites,
dashboards, slide shows), scientific writing, diagnostic interviews (focus on
mood disorders), application of research instruments in mental health, and
presentation of works in scientific congresses in the research projects called
"Predictors of neuroprogression and conversion among mood disorders: a
prospective study with a community sample of young adults" and "Therapeutic
process, psychosocial factors and biological factors in two models of
psychotherapy for depression" linked to the Graduate Program and m Health and
Behavior at the Catholic University of Pelotas. I work with statistical
learning, mainly in the development of classification models for outcomes in the
area of ​​mental health. I perform data analysis with big data and bleeding edge
machine learning techniques within the mental health area at the Molecular
Psychiatry Laboratory at Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, in addition to
performing scientific writing activities, reviewing articles for two
periodicals, The R Journal (in the R programming area focused on machine
learning, psychiatry/psychology, epidemiology and cohort studies) and The
Journal of Open Source Software (participating in the review of papers in the
field of open source software focused on data analysis). I also participate in
the research group Alliance (Artificial Intelligence in Neuroscience)
coordinated by Dr. Ives Cavalcante Passos. Within the programming area, I have
extensive experience and familiarity with the R programming language and
previous experience with Python, focused on data science solutions. I have
collaborated on projects related to functionality, substance use, sleep quality,
cognition, suicide and personality disorders. I've participated in complementary
training in the areas of machine learning, R programming, psychometrics, applied
statistics, Linux systems, among others. Since April 2022, I have participated
in the project "Precision psychiatry: use of big data analysis with artificial
intelligence techniques to predict clinical outcomes in mental health" linked to
the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul.
