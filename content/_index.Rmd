# BRUNO MONTEZANO

## _Psychologist and Data Analyst_

I'm currently pursuing a Master of Science degree in
[Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences](https://www.ufrgs.br/ppgpsiquiatria/) at
[Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul](http://www.ufrgs.br/ufrgs/inicial).
I earned my Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the
[Catholic University of Pelotas](https://ucpel.edu.br/) (2021).
I also earned my Computer Technician degree from the
[Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Rio Grande do Sul](https://ifrs.edu.br/) (2015).
I perform data analysis with big data and bleeding edge machine learning
techniques within the mental health area, what's being called as "precision
psychiatry".
I'm a big fan of FOSS technologies, Linux, statistical programming,
reproducible science, chess and a nice tea.
